		<h3 id="install"><strong>A) Install Plugin</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Split Test URL  Rotator contains a WordPress plugin that must be installed in your blog.</p>
    <p>To install it, upload wp-split-test.zip within the WordPress admin panel, just like any other WordPress plugins and activate it.</p>
		
		<p><img src="assets/images/installplugin.png" alt="Install Plugin" /></p>
		
		<p>After the plugin is activated, the plugin can be found under the WordPress Settings menu in the dashboard.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="create"><strong>B) Create a New Split Test</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>Before you can create a new split test, you'll need to select or create a new page. Note: Only the URL of this page will be used and none of the content on this page will be shown. It is also advisable to create your landing page or offer pages prior to setup so you don't need to keep going back to the pages menu.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 1: Setup the Rotator Page</h4>
        
        <p>Go to the plugin. On the plugin's "settings" tab, select the blank page you created previously. (If you didn't create a new page prior to setup, then create a blank page now and then select it here.)

		<p><img src="assets/images/settings.png" alt="Settings" /></p>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Setup the URLs  to Multiple Landing Pages or Offer Pages</h4>
        
        <p>Click on the "Landing Pages" or the "Offer Pages" tab. Basically they will do the same thing but the separate tabs allows you to separate out different types of split testing that you want to do and keep it organized in its own list.</p>
        
        <p>On either tab (landing pages or offer pages tab), you'll want to enter the following information:
        
        <ol>
        <li>Click "Add Rotation" button.<br><img src="assets/images/add-rotation.png" alt="Install Plugin" /></li>
        
        <li>Name the split test by entering the name into the "Profile" field and enter the number of pages you want to test by entering the number into "Rotations" field.<br><img src="assets/images/profile-rotations.png" alt="Profile Name & Rotations" /></li>
        <li>Enter the URL for the landing pages you want to test into "Landing URL 1", "Landing URL 2", etc. Include http:// in the URL.<br><img src="assets/images/url-weight.png" alt="Add URL & Weight" /></li>
        <li>Enter the weight that you want to apply to each URL into "Weightable for URL 1", "Weightable for URL 2", etc. (Note: the weight is a percentage of traffic that comes to the page you setup in step 1 that will be redirected to URL 1 or 2 or 3... If you add up all the numbers entered into the "weight" field for all the landing pages or offers they should equal 100.)</li>
        <li>Click on the "Add" button.<br><img src="assets/images/add.png" alt="Add" /></li>
        <li>Click the "Save" button. It should say "Done" and display the URL when it is saved properly. If it still says "Refresh to view" like the screenshot below then it hasn't been saved yet and you'll need to click "save" button to finialize it.<br><img src="assets/images/save.png" alt="Save" />
        </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Step 3: Start Testing</h4>
        
        <p>Use the URL listed beside the profile name in your advertising to split test the different landing pages or offers that you just setup. If you've just created your split test, then you may need to refresh the page before the URL appears here.</p>

 		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="edit"><strong>C) View/Stats/Delete Split Tests</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>View the split tests that you've setup on the &quot;Landing Pages&quot; or &quot;Offer Pages&quot;  tab. To view the different URLs for each profile, click on the pie chart icon. The statistics for the number of views for each URL can be found here too.</p>
 		<p>Delete a split test by clicking on the red "x" icon beside the profile name.</p>

		<p>That's pretty much all there is to this plugin, have fun with it and thanks for your interest. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to plugins on CodeCanyon, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
